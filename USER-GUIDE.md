# _XChemAlign_ User Guide

_XChemAlign_ is a small suite of tools for preparing PDB models for loading into into [Fragalysis](https://fragalysis.diamond.ac.uk/).

* It formalises sites and packing artefacts across crystal forms and conformations, aligning models, maps and artefacts to common origins for each binding site.
* It handles model updates and multiple repeat experiments (e.g. to resolve stereochemistry).
* It allows for fast release cycles through supporting incremental updates.
* It assists efficient curation of auto-identified features, by running fast and on the minimal set of files in any given iteration.

## Overview

There a few steps involved.
1. [**Enable**](https://github.com/mwinokan/xchem-align/blob/master/USER-GUIDE.md#1-enabling-the-xchemalign-environment) the XChemAlign environment
1. [**Declare**](https://github.com/mwinokan/xchem-align/blob/master/USER-GUIDE.md#2-declaring-things) a few things about your data in two structured files in `yaml`[^1]
2. [**Collate**](https://github.com/mwinokan/xchem-align/blob/master/USER-GUIDE.md#3-collating-files) your files in a new (speicific) directory structure
3. [**Align**](https://github.com/mwinokan/xchem-align/blob/master/USER-GUIDE.md#4-aligning-everything) all binding sites to common origins
4. [**Release**](https://github.com/mwinokan/xchem-align/blob/master/USER-GUIDE.md#5-releasing-to-fragalysis) the data to Fragalysis
6. **Re-release** additional data by repeating (some or all) of steps 1-6.

If you won't run this at Diamond, you will first have to set up your environment and copy over files. See the [instructions below](https://github.com/mwinokan/xchem-align/blob/master/USER-GUIDE.md#non-diamond-instructions)

[^1]: "yet another markup language"

## 1. Enabling the XChemAlign environment

If you are uploading your data from diamond light source then this is as simple as running the commands:

```commandline
source /dls/science/groups/i04-1/conor_dev/xchem-align/act
conda activate /dls/science/groups/i04-1/conor_dev/xchem-align/env_xchem_align
```

## 2. Declaring things

In order to run XChemAlign you will need to create two files:
1. The config.yaml file
2. The crystalforms.yaml file

### 2.1. The Config Yaml

The config yaml defines what data to collect for collation. This will include raw crystalographic data, PanDDA data and ligand information.

```yaml
# DO NOT USE TABS FOR THE WHITESPACE!
target_name: Mpro  # The name of your target. If you already have data on Fragalysis it should be the 'target' name that
                   # it appears under
base_dir: /some/path/to/test-data/inputs_1  # The directory that inputs (not output_dir!) are relative to. For users at
                                            # Diamond this should be set to '/'
output_dir: /some/path/to/test-data/outputs  # The directory that will contain all your upload folders. This path is
                                             # NOT relative to base_dir.
ref_datasets:  # A set of exemplar datasets that you want aligned to every ligand binding site. If you have multiple
              # major classes of conformations there should be at least one of each class.
  - Mpro-IBM0045  # There are given with the dataset folder name/crystal id as it appears in the
                  # model_building directory
inputs:  # The datasources to collate
  - dir: dls/labxchem/data/2020/lb27995-1  # The target directory. This will pull data from
                                            # 'dir/processing/analysis/modeL_building'. This is relative to 'base_dir'.
    type: model_building  # This will always be model_building unless you have datasets from the pdb you want to align
                          # which is an advanced topic not covered here.
    soakdb: processing/database/soakDBDataFile.sqlite  # The path to the soakdb database relative to 'dir'.
    # Datasets that are not to be processed with XChemAlign can be added to a list to exclude
    exclude: [  
      Mpro-IBM0057,
    ]
    panddas_event_files:  # The paths to the inspect tables of the PanDDAs used to model the bound state.
    - processing/analysis/panddas/analyses/pandda_inspect_events.csv  # Again these are relative to 'dir'.

```

### 2.2. The crystalforms Yamls

This file specifies both the biological *assemblies* and *crystalforms* relative to some reference PDBs. YAML has a strict formatting specification. Make sure to use spaces and not tabs for whitespace. The diagram below illustrates the format of the crystalforms file:

![crystalforms-yaml-example](https://github.com/xchem/xchem-align/assets/36866506/5c3ad74e-b1ff-4f44-8adb-3a76fbdc42b3)

The example file can be found [here](test-data/outputs/crystalforms.yaml). The `biomol` and `chains` directives specify the mapping between chains in the PDB file (`chains`) to chains in the assembly (`biomol`). I.e. in the example above the assembly "dimer-inhibited" is formed of three chains **A,B,C** which correspond to chains **C,E,A** in the **largecellpdb**.

## 3. Collating files

The first step is to collate your data. This process analyses your crystallographic data, PanDDA events, and ligand files and automatically determines the links between them.

```commandline
mkdir <path to your output_dir>/upload_1
python /dls/science/groups/i04-1/conor_dev/xchem-align/scripts/collate.py -c <your upload config file>
```

## 4. Aligning everything

The next step is performing local alignments of your ligand bound models and their associated crystallographic maps.

```commandline
python /dls/science/groups/i04-1/conor_dev/xchem-align/scripts/align.py -d <your upload directory> -x <your crystalforms.yaml file>
```

## 5. Upload to Fragalysis

An automatic tool for Fragalysis upload has not yet been written. The XCA outputs should be zipped and uploaded to Fragalysis via the [/viewer/upload_tset/ page](https://fragalysis.diamond.ac.uk/viewer/upload_tset/)

# Non-Diamond instructions

1. **Set up** _(only once)_ your runtime environment _(easy)_
2. **Copy** relevant files from Diamond _(if not at Diamond)_

## 1. Setting up runtime environment _(only once)_

To run the XChemAlign tools you need to setup a Python environment.
This is described in more detail in the [Developer guide](DEV-GUIDE.md), but just to run the tools do this:

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install .

Make sure you use Python 3.10. Earlier versions will not work, and later ones have not been tested.
Those steps just install what you need to run the tools, not to develop them.
You only need to set up this environment once.

## 2. Copying files from Diamond _(if not at Diamond)_

This copies the necessary data from the Diamond file system to create an independent set of files that
can be worked with locally. The data for a single crystal is HUGE and it is not realistic to copy the
complete set of files, so `copier` just copies those that are required.

If you can run directly against the Diamond files system you do not need to use this tool.

This tool reads the SoakDB file (found at `processing/database/soakDBDataFile.sqlite`), reads the files that
are needed from the `mainTable` database table and copies those files to the output directory.
From there they can be tarred up and copied to your local system.

Copier can be run in 2 modes:
1. SSH to Diamond, and copy the files there, (`copy` mode), then tar of zip up those copied files and copy the archive
   to your working environment.
2. Use SCP to copy the files from Diamond directly your working environment (`scp` mode).

Both modes require you to have SSH login credentials t Diamond (e.g. a FedID account and a SSH key).
`scp` mode is simpler to run, but a lot slower.

The settings can be provided in a `config.yaml` file or as commandline arguments, or as a bit of both.
When running in `copy` mode using commandline arguments is probably easier, when running in `scp` mode using a config
file is probably easier.

A `config.yaml` file will look like this:

```yaml
target_name: Mpro
output_dir: data/outputs/Mpro

scp:
  server: ssh.diamond.ac.uk
  username: gse84885
  key: /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa
  base_dir: /

inputs:
- dir: dls/labxchem/data/2020/lb18145-153
  type: model_building
  soakdb: processing/database/soakDBDataFile.sqlite
  panddas_event_files:
    - processing/analysis/pandda_2_2020_04_25/analyses/pandda_inspect_events.csv
    - processing/analysis/pandda_2_2020_04_30/analyses/pandda_inspect_events.csv
    - processing/analysis/pandda_2_2020_05_10/analyses/pandda_inspect_events.csv
```

Some notes about this file:

1. The same file is used to configure the collator tool, which you will run after copying. As the outputs of `copier`
   are the inputs of `collator` some of the names can be confusing.
2. The `scp` section contains your SSH credentials that are used when using `scp` mode.
3. The default for `scp.server` is `ssh.diamond.ac.uk` so you do not actually need this setting.
4. If you don't specify a SSH key then all your SSH keys (in the ~/ssh directory) are loaded.
5. The default for `scp.base_dir` is `/` so you do not actually need this setting.
6. There can be multiple values for the contents of `inputs`. If so all are copied, unless the `--input-dir` option is
   specified, in which case just that one input is copied.
7. When copying multiple inputs some of the commandline options become ambiguous so can't be used.
8. When not using a config file, only a single input can be copied. Run multiple times to copy multiple visits.
9. Commandline options take preference over settings in the config file.

Usage:
```commandline
$ python -m xchemalign.copier --help
usage: copier.py [-h] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-b BASE_DIR] [-i INPUT_DIR] [-s SOAKDB_FILE] [-p [PANDDAS_FILES ...]] -m {copy,scp} [--scp-username SCP_USERNAME] [--scp-server SCP_SERVER] [--scp-key SCP_KEY] -o OUTPUT_DIR
                 [-l LOG_FILE] [--log-level LOG_LEVEL]

copier

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        Configuration file
  -b BASE_DIR, --base-dir BASE_DIR
                        Base directory. If running against the Diamond file system use /
  -i INPUT_DIR, --input-dir INPUT_DIR
                        Input directory (relative to base-dir) e.g. the dir with the data for your visit. e.g. dls/labxchem/data/2020/lb18145-153
  -s SOAKDB_FILE, --soakdb-file SOAKDB_FILE
                        Path to soakdb file relative to input-dir. Default is processing/database/soakDBDataFile.sqlite
  -p [PANDDAS_FILES ...], --panddas-files [PANDDAS_FILES ...]
                        Paths to CSV files with panddas data relative to input-dir
  -m {copy,scp}, --mode {copy,scp}
                        Mode of file copying
  --scp-username SCP_USERNAME
                        SCP username
  --scp-server SCP_SERVER
                        SCP server
  --scp-key SCP_KEY     SSH key
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR
                        Output directory
  -l LOG_FILE, --log-file LOG_FILE
                        File to write logs to
  --log-level LOG_LEVEL
                        Logging level (0=INFO, 1=WARN, 2=ERROR)
```

Example using `scp` mode with only commandline options:
```commandline
$ python -m xchemalign.copier -b / -i dls/labxchem/data/2020/lb18145-153 \
  -p processing/analysis/pandda_2_2020_04_25/analyses/pandda_inspect_events.csv \
  processing/analysis/pandda_2_2020_04_30/analyses/pandda_inspect_events.csv \
  processing/analysis/pandda_2_2020_05_10/analyses/pandda_inspect_events.csv \
  -o xca-outputs -m scp --scp-user=username --scp-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

That example copies the required data for the visit found at `/dls/labxchem/data/2020/lb18145-153` to the output directory
`xca-outputs`. The full paths of the files are retained, and typically the required files can be located
anywhere under the `processing` directory in unpredictable locations.
Only the SoakDB database knows where the necessary files are actually located.

The files copied are:
* the soakdb sqlite database file
* the PDB and MTZ files for each crystal
* the CIF file for the ligand in the crystal
* the panddas event map data in `pandda_inspect_events.csv` files
* the *best* panddas event map (`.ccp4` file) identified from the `.csv` file

Example using `scp` mode with config file options:
```commandline
$ python -m xchemalign.copier -c config.yaml -o xca-outputs -m scp
```

For using `copy` mode just change `--mode scp` to `--mode copy`.
The key difference is that `scp` mode is run remotely from your working environment whereas to use `copy` mode you must
first ssh to `ssh.diamond.ac.uk`, then run copier (having created a new working Python environment), then zip up the
copied files and copy them back to your working environment.
